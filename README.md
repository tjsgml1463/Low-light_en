# Contrast Enhancement for Low-Light Image Enhancement: a Survey
## abstract
In this paper, various contrast and low-light image enhancement methods are described and classified into three categories: i) histogram-based, ii) transmission map-based, and iii) retinex-based methods. The performance of image enhancement algorithm is evaluated by comparing the resulting images using low-contrast and low-light images acquired under different illumination conditions. Various image enhancement algorithms are analyzed in the sense of both performance and efficiency. The described image enhancement algorithms can be applied to various visual surveillance or video analytics applications with low-light, low-contrast video inputs.
